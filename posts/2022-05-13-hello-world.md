Hello! Welcome to the blog. It's so nice to meet you! Make yourself comfortable and grab a beanbag chair. I stocked up on your favorite drink in the fridge. (It was almost sold out but I got the last one just for you)

This is just a blog post to say hello. I'm going to be updating this blog with stuff that I find interesting but I would feel bad about rambling to another person. Like, I don't think I could sell anyone on finding [Egyptian Fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction) interesting but I think they're neat and I want to talk about them.

Hopefully you can just bear with me while I get everything sorted with the site. I've been trying to tweak with the CSS for a bit too long and it's still not *quite* right but it'll get there. In any case, I hope that you can find some weird nerd topics through this site. I'll see you soon after everything is ready.
