# Rules:

Classic Sudoku rules. In addition, consecutive numbers on the Indiana border cannot add up to 9 (i.e., 9, 1+8, 1+2+6).

# Background:

I made this puzzle as the summer of 2021 came to a close on August 13. I was thinking about going back to college in Indiana and I wanted to make a puzzle about it. I already made one puzzle with the Purdue logo so I wanted to try incorporating the state into the puzzle. Initially, I tried to use Indiana's highway system as the lines to form a Slitherlink but it became very tedious to trace over these maps accurately. Then I came up with the idea to superimpose the border of the state on a sudoku after playing a German Whispers Sudoku with Germany superimposed on the grid. The puzzle was found in the [WPF 2020 Newsletter](wpf-link). The additional constraint was created so the border could have some relevance to the puzzle. I believe I landed on that specific constraint because I was doing some Kakuro around the same time and had the sums to 9 still rattling in my head. In hindsight, the constraint is difficult to explain and I would probably replace it with another one but I'm still satisfied with the puzzle overall.
