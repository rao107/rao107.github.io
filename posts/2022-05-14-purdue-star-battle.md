# Rules:

Fill in the stars such that there is exactly one star in each horizontal row and diagonals as well as only one star in each of the bolded regions. Stars cannot be placed in adjacent hexagons and share an edge. Shading is purely cosmetic.

# Background:

This was one of my first puzzles that I made and the first one that I started sending out to my friends to see how they liked it. I made it around late July 2021 and I've kept it around as a way to advertise Puzzle Club on our campus as a kind of "teaser" puzzle. The rules are not super complicated, it's thematic to being in Purdue, and the puzzle itself is not *super* difficult (at least compared to other puzzles).
