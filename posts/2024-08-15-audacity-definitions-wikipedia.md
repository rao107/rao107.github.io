### I love editing Wikipedia

From tracking down sources to rewriting prose, editing Wikipedia is one of my favorite hobbies. Wikipedia bills itself as the sum of human knowledge and I'd like to think my contributions make it just a little bit better. I usually like to edit math or statistics topics since I have some relevant background in theoretical computer science (TCS).

The articles that inspired me to make this blog post is the [Geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), the only [memoryless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness) probability distribution. I initially started working on improving its prose after some conversations while I was in college made me realize that this distribution wasn't well-known to people who hadn't taken a first course in probability. I had to explain what the geometric distribution was to my peers on multiple occasions when calculating the expected time in my TCS Toolkit class. I figured that if my friends couldn't immediately understand it from a quick Wikipedia search, the article might need some love.

As of writing this blog post, I believe it's been much improved but still needs care for its prose and a fuller discussion about what a probability distribution encyclopedia page should really encompass. In other words, I kept chucking sources at it but never stopped to make sure everything was actually digestable for a college student just learning about probability. Someday I'll come back to complete it (lying).
