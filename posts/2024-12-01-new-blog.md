# Hello again!

It's been too long! How's everything been? I hope you've been doing well. Yeah, I changed things around here. It's just a little redecorating really. I just decided I wanted to try switching over from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and I have some thoughts about it.

First off, I think it looks *a lot* better. Having a lot more control over the look and feel of my blog is a super big positive. Compared to the previous blog that was mostly generated by Jekyll, I can implement and modify my own article templates easily. I could probably still do the modifications I wanted, but Jekyll used Ruby which I'm not particularly well-versed in. Making changes or installing plugins would mean trying to learn a bunch of new things when I really only wanted a small change. With this new website, I can do whatever I want pretty easily since everything is in Javascript.

I'm also using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling which is honestly really nice. I've found supporting different screen widths is fairly simple using Tailwind. In my old site, I really only had a mobile mode and a desktop mode with no idea how things would look on a 4K monitor. With the help of Chromium's device toolbar and my friend Keagen who has an insanely big monitor, I'm more assured that it will look good. The only small problem is that I'm not a designer by trade. I do my best to make things look nice here, and I think I did pretty well. I also had my friend [Ryan](https://www.ryankaodesigns.com/) look at this to get some comments.

For the forseeable future, I'm planning on sticking with this design. I have some more ideas about how to improve my website but I think I've spent too long recreating it. I'll steadily and continually improve it when I can make time for it. Until then, I hope you enjoy your stay here!
