### Hello from my new blog!

I decided to remake my site in Next.js and using Tailwind and stuff. I think it looks SO much better than how it looked before. No more blog template stuff, this is all made by me :)

I thought that I might have to axe this blog going from my previous Jekyll library to this but I'm glad I found out about the `gray-matter` library. It's super cool! It's probably also how Jekyll converted the markdown into html anyways.

I really enjoy having so much more control over how my site looks instead of trying to work within the blog templates already made. I tried going for a "business card" type of look with this site. It could also look like a very big canvas? Either way, it looks fancy and cool and I like it a lot more.
